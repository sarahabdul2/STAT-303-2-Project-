This is a regression problem, in that we want to measure alcohol consumption, a continuous variable. Since we want to consider the effect of these predictors on the response variable, we will primarily focus on inference. We may incorporate a prediction component for future years if we are able to develop a solid-enough model and find sufficient training data.  \n",

We don’t want our understanding of model accuracy to be clouded by greater penalization of large errors, as this approach does not make sense in our lower-stakes context.

Additional stakeholders include investors in the alcohol industry, alcohol retailers and vendors and marketing agencies that target alcohol consumers. When it comes to how our project will benefit stakeholders, manufacturers and distributors could use our predictions and conclusions to better plan production in global markets and allocate resources/funding, whereas policy-makers would wound up more informed and able to improve their decisions around alcohol regulation and focus public health campaigns in areas where the predicted alcohol assumption is higher. Public health organizations could benefit from our project in identifying where alcohol-related health issues will arise, whereas researchers could identify new, promising areas of research. Lastly, investors could use our predictions to better inform their investment decisions, retailers/vendors to better allocate inventory & prices and marketing agencies to significantly improve their targeting through our project’s insights on different geographical regions.\n",
